Download the release on the right (source code and the ts.zip). The source code contains the max patches and the ts.zip is the model)
Remember that Max needs to know where the patch an all the subpatches of this interface and the model is stored otherwise it will not find the patches + the model.
You can add patchs under options/file preferences (Check the subfolder box)

Please read before using the Max Patch because there are some steps you need to follow before:

1. You need to install the nn~ Max object. Instructions are found here: https://github.com/acids-ircam/nn_tilde
2. The patch uses the TouchOsc ios app (I am not sure if this exists for Android).
Inside the app you need to enable the accelerometer and setup the OSC connection with the correct port (I recommend 7400) and the correct local ip adress.
