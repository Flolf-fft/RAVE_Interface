README

The patch uses the TouchOsc ios app (I am not sure if this exists for Android).
Inside the app you need to enable the accelerometer and setup the OSC connection with the correct port (I recommend 7400) and the correct local ip adress.

Installation:
Just download zip from the latest release. This contains all needed bpatchers and one model.
