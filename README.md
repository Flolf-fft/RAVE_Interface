Please read before using the Max Patch because there are some steps you need to follow before:

1. You need to install the nn~ Max object. Instructions are found here: https://github.com/acids-ircam/nn_tilde
2. The patch uses the TouchOsc ios app (I am not sure if this exists for Android).
Inside the app you need to enable the accelerometer and setup the OSC connection with the correct port (I recommend 7400) and the correct local ip adress.
